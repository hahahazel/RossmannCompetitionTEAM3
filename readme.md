The task is to predict the sales of Rossmann stores 6 weeks ahead.
But is it a daily sale, or are we better of with a weekly sales?
For planning purposes the Rossmann administration does probably not care about daily sales.  They need rather to plan stock and logistics, which might be better done on a weekly level.

### Data
Data is the Rossmann data from Kaggle, which contains daily sales figures for 1115 stores in the period 2011 to 2015.
